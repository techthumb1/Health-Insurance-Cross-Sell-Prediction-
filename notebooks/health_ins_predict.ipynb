    "# Healthcare Insurance Cross Sell Prediction\n",
    "\n",
    "Whether we as consumers despise or appreciate the need, or requirement to have insurance, companies understand that those who have insurance are more likely to buy more insurance. This is the basis of cross selling. Cross selling is the practice of selling additional products or services to existing customers. In this notebook, we will be looking at a dataset from Kaggle that contains information about customers and whether or not they have purchased health insurance. We will be using this dataset to build a model that will predict whether or not a customer will purchase health insurance based on the information provided.\n",

    "The first step in any data science project is to import the necessary libraries. In this notebook, we will be using the following libraries:\n",
    "\n",
    "* [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) - Pandas is a fast, powerful, flexible and easy to use open source data analysis and manipulation tool, built on top of the Python programming language.\n",
    "* [Numpy](https://numpy.org/) - NumPy is the fundamental package for scientific computing with Python.\n",
    "* [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) - Matplotlib is a comprehensive library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python.\n",
    "* [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/) - Seaborn is a Python data visualization library based on matplotlib. It provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive and informative statistical graphics.\n",
    "* [Scikit-Learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/) - Scikit-learn is a free software machine learning library for the Python programming language.\n",
